  Hi, maybe you want to hire me, do it please, I really need the experience, thank you in advance ^^

  Since this repository is public and this account is exclussively made for Job applications and official stuff, this means I may not be able to publish projects that were made under my more popular pseudonym but I like the idea of starting from ground up using only the foundations of web developing (Just html, css, and javascript like the old times).

  It is weird to see the contribiutions table so empty. Gotta fix that
  
  The page has been published, there are some many things to do!!!! I have done this before, but I feel kind of rusty. I think it would be helpful to write down what I want to do to set the foundations of the page this week.
  To do:
    -Set the barebone HTML Index page with all the elements I will need (basically an interactive CV).
      -Header (Will maintain the header design on all pages) (CSS: Fixed)
        -A title
        -Anchors to other sections of the page
          -Home (Index)
          -Blog
          -Gallery
          -Projects
      -Body (Changes in each page)
        -General Information (Bio)
        -Contact Information
        -Experience
        -Thanks section
          -[Credit the people that developed the Open Source code I'll use]
      -Footer (Maintain on all pages) (CSS: Fixed)
        -Random buttons
          -[I plan to change the css style files for the page]
    -Figure out a layout that will fit my needs for this personal page
      -Adaptative
        -Since it is a personal page, it must look decent in mobile browsers
      -Modular
        -I have great plans for this page and I plan to add some crazy css animations to have some fun, moving things aroude should be as easy as possibl
    -Reasearch what jekyll is
